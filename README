//Assuming expression given in product of sum form

//Input:
//first integer input as number of clauses, second number of variables
//Then continuous inputs for each variable. 1 if variable is a, -1 is abar, and 0 if variable not present in clause
//Example:
//(a+b)(abar+c)
//2 3 --no. of clauses is 2    no. of variables is 3
//1 -1 --a
//1 0 --b
//0 1 --c

//Output SAT or UNSAT
//if SAT then it tells whether the variable should be 1 or 0 (-1 means 0) for solution
//else UNSAT
